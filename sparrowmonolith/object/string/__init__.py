The purpose of this module is to deal with formatting of strings
that otherwise are not provided in normal Python functions.

There is some overlap with path functions as paths are normally
subsets of strings. All functions that deal with paths for files
are handled in the meta programing section. Functions which 
deal with IO of simple files are in the `io` module.
